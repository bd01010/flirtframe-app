# FlirtFrame iOS Development on PC

Since you're on a PC, here are your options for iOS development with Firebase:

## Option 1: Cloud-Based Mac (Recommended)
Use a Mac in the cloud service to build your iOS app:

### Services:
1. **MacStadium** - Dedicated Mac hosting
   - https://www.macstadium.com
   - $99/month for basic Mac Mini

2. **MacinCloud** - Pay as you go
   - https://www.macincloud.com
   - $1/hour or $20/month

3. **AWS EC2 Mac Instances**
   - https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/mac/
   - ~$25/day

## Option 2: GitHub Actions (Already Set Up!)
Your project already has GitHub Actions configured. You can:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions will build your app on macOS
3. It can deploy to TestFlight automatically

To use this:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Firebase integration"
git push origin main
```

## Option 3: Local Firebase Development
While you can't build the iOS app on PC, you can:

1. **Test Firebase Functions Locally**
```bash
# Start Firebase emulators
firebase emulators:start

# Access the emulator UI
# http://localhost:4000
```

2. **Develop and Test Firebase Rules**
```bash
# Deploy rules changes
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules
```

3. **Monitor Firebase Console**

## Option 4: Remote Development
1. **VS Code Remote Development**
   - Connect to a Mac via SSH
   - Develop on PC, build on Mac

2. **Team Collaboration**
   - Have a team member with a Mac build
   - You handle Firebase backend

## Next Steps on PC:
1. Continue developing Firebase rules and security
2. Test Firebase functions with emulators
3. Monitor analytics and crashes in Firebase Console
4. Use GitHub Actions for automated builds

## When You Get Mac Access:
Everything is ready! Just:
1. Open FlirtFrame.xcodeproj in Xcode
2. Let it download packages (2-3 minutes)  
3. Build and run!

The Firebase integration is complete and will work as soon as Xcode resolves the packages.
