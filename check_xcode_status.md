# How to Check if Xcode Finished Downloading Firebase

## Signs that it's DONE:

1. **Status Bar** (bottom of Xcode window):
   - Shows "Ready" or shows nothing
   - No longer says "Resolving Package Dependencies" or "Downloading..."

2. **Left Sidebar**:
   - You'll see "Package Dependencies" section
   - Under it, you'll see "firebase-ios-sdk" with a disclosure triangle
   - Clicking the triangle shows all Firebase modules

3. **Activity Indicator**:
   - The spinning wheel in the top toolbar stops
   - No progress bars visible

## If it's taking too long (>5 minutes):

1. **Force a refresh**:
   - File → Packages → Resolve Package Versions
   - Or press Cmd+Shift+K (Clean), then Cmd+B (Build)

2. **Check for errors**:
   - Look in the Issue Navigator (left sidebar, warning triangle icon)
   - Check if there are any red error messages

## Quick Test:
Try building the project (Cmd+B). If it starts compiling, the packages are downloaded!

## Typical download times:
- Fast internet: 2-3 minutes
- Average internet: 3-5 minutes
- Slow internet: 5-10 minutes

The Firebase SDK is about 200-300 MB, so it depends on your connection speed.
